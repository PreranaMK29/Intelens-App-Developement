# Intelens
Our app 'Intelens' is a user-friendly app designed for intellectually disabled children aged 8-15, offering engaging activities to stimulate their minds. 
The app features 3 main sections: 
- Learning-where games like Pattern Matching, Counting improve their cognitive abilities
- Speech-where children communicate their basic needs to their parents using audio prompts
- Life Skills-where social awareness is taught through videos.  
Using Firebase, we included a Mood feedback system that kept track of the student's emotions and notified the parent accordingly.
